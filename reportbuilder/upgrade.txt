Information provided here is intended especially for developers.

=== 4.1 ===
* 'set_default_per_page' and 'get_default_per_page' methods have been added to \local\report\base class
  to manage the default displayed rows per page.
* Added two new methods in the datasource class:
    - add_all_from_entity() to add all columns/filters/conditions from the given entity to the report at once
    - add_all_from_entities() to add all columns/filters/conditions from all the entities added to the report at once
* New database helper methods for generating multiple unique values: `generate_aliases` and `generate_param_names`
* The base aggregation `format_value` method has a `$columntype` argument in order to preserve type during aggregation. When
  defining column callbacks, strict typing will now be preserved in your callback methods when the column is being aggregated
* The method `get_joins()` in the base entity class is now public, allowing for easier joins within reports
